/*
 * the purpose of this script is to move the bee geom around in its local coordinate 
 * system, reacting to collisions, pushing some of that information back into the
 * bee camera, and to create a pleasing, non-reptitious response to camera control.
 * The camera is what moves, the Bee geometry is a child of the camera, and can move
 * in it's own local space, yet it is still a collision detector, so it can bounce around
 * without jarring the camera.
